In a large bowl, combine the pork, ginger, garlic, spring onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, egg and cabbage. Stir until well mixed.

Place 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling onto each wonton skin. Moisten edges with water and fold edges over to form a triangle shape. Roll edges slightly to seal in filling. Set dumplings aside on a lightly floured surface until ready to cook.

To cook: Steam dumplings in batches in a covered bamboo or metal steamer for about 15 to 20 minutes. Serve immediately.
